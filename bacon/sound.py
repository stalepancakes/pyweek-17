    Sounds can be streamed by specifying ``stream=True``; this causes them to load faster but incur a small
    latency on playback.  Background music should always be streamed.  Sound effects should not be streamed.

    Sounds are kept in memory until explicitly unloaded, see :func:`unload`.

    '''Handle to a single instance of a sound.  Voices can be used to:

    - Modify the parameters of a sound while it's playing (for example, its gain, pan, or pitch)
    - Pause and resume playback
    - Determine the current playback head position and seek to a different position
    - Provide a callback for when the sound finishes playing
    - Create and control a sound that loops automatically

    A voice is created to play back a single sound instance once (besides any looping), and cannot be reused to play 
    another sound, or even to play the same sound once playback of that sound completes.

    Do not use a ``Voice`` to play simple sound effects that do not require control during playing; see :func:`Sound.play`.

    Create a voice by first loading the sound, then creating a voice to play it::

        engine_sound = bacon.Sound('res/Engine.wav')
        engine_voice = bacon.Voice(engine_sound)
        engine_voice.play()

    Specify the ``loop`` parameter to play music that loops until stopped::

        music_sound = bacon.Sound('res/MyMusic.ogg', stream=True)
        music_voice = bacon.Voice(music_sound, loop=True)
        music_voice.play()

    Voices become invalid when their sound completes (after their callback returns, if one is set).  Continuing to use
    a voice after it has finished will result in an exception; you can check the state of a voice with :attr:`playing`.

    Paused voices remain in memory until explicitly destroyed with :func:`destroy`.
